## keras-rl examples

This set of examples is based on the the [keras-rl](https://keras-rl/keras-rl) toolbox.  
Highly starred on GitHub and once widely used, this repository seems to no longer be in active
development, no doubt partly in preference to some of the newer entrants.  

Only works on tensorflow 1.14.0, appears to be broken on tensorflow 1.15.x or 2.x.  GPU version
of tensorflow 1.14.0 will require CUDA 10.0, and will not run with the more recent ones.

See requirements.txt to get started.
