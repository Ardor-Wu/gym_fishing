Here is the fishing gym. Work IN PROGRESS!

## Environments

So far, we have:

Simple fishing model defined in a continuous state space of fish biomass, with:

- Discrete action space with three actions: maintain harvest level, increase harvest by 20%, decrease harvest by 20%
- Discrete action space with n > 3 actions: action is taken as quota, `quota = action / n_actions * K`
- Continuous action space, `action` = quota.

## Examples

Examples for running this gym environment in several frameworks:

- [keras-rl](/keras-rl)
  * [DQN](examples/keras-rl/fishing.py)
- [tensorflow/agents](/tf-agents)
  * [DQN](https://github.com/boettiger-lab/gym_fishing/blob/master/examples/tf-agents/dqn_fishing-v0.py)
- [stable baselines](/stable-baselines)
  * [PPO](stable-baselines/stable-baselines-ppo.Rmd)
